Part 1: 

this  project we are using Token based authetication 

Part 2:

Part2: now we are going to to refactor Auth.js 

there are two methods A: restictToUserWithOutLogin B: checkAuth which have mutiple duplicate code ....

now  i creating  a fuction which handle the  both case if user not null  and in first when use visit the service .

fot this use case now  i again use cookies based Authetication...

A user can have  multiple  roles

Normal user cal only view only his genrated urls.

But as Admin user can access  all urls  generated by any User..

to generate Token user must be go the Login page  it return a Token 

this Generated Token can be use by User using Postman to view acces the urls.
